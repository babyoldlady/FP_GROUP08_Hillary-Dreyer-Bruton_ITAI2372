## Brief Project Description: 
#### Final Project Brief:

The goal of ITAI's 2372 final group project was to design a conceptual AI-driven solution for use by NASA Space Missions. We were tasked to include: 

- A detailed proposal outlining the problem statement and objectives
- A comprehensive solution plan describing the integration of AI
- A robust testing and validation framework
  
#### NASA Space Mission AI Project Introduction and Problem Statement: 

Efficient power distribution is critical for space missions where energy is limited and multiple subsystems compete for power. A robust power management system ensures that mission-critical operations remain uninterrupted while optimizing energy usage. Below is a detailed solution and testing plan written to address efficient power distribution for NASA space missions.

*Conceptual Project Objectives:*
- Prioritize energy allocation to mission-critical systems.
- Minimize energy wastage by optimizing power routing.
- Ensure redundancy to handle component failures.
- Balance the power demands of scientific instruments, life-support systems, propulsion, and communication.

This conceptual design aims to address the unique challenges of power distribution in space, providing a scalable, efficient and reliable solution to meet NASA's operational demands.
